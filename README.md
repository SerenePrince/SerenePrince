# 👋 Hi, I'm **Noah Park-Nguyen**  
A student at **Algonquin College** studying **Computer Science**. I'm all about software development, IT, and everything **fullstack**. Whether it's building back-end systems, crafting sleek front-end interfaces, or exploring new technologies, I'm always up for a challenge. I love starting new projects, almost as much as I love leaving them unfinished.
